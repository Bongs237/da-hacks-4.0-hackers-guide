# Judging & Criteria

## üèÜ How Judging Works
In order to be judged, you'll need to submit your project on [Devpost](https://dahacks3-5.devpost.com/). On the Devpost, you give all the information about your project, including your team. In order to win a prize, you must be physically present during judging to demo your project to the judges.

TODO CHANGE JUDGING SECTION TO HOW NEW SYSTEM WORKS
Judging will be done expo-style ‚Äî because I love the smell of Expo markers. *Inhales* AHHHHHHHHH don't we all? I'm so sorry; don't judge me.

Speaking of judging, you will present your project to judges as they walk around to you. You'll have up to 5 minutes (3 min demo + 2 min Q&A) with each judge, so keep your demo concise, clear, and functional. Slides are okay, but focus on showing your product ‚Äî hackathons are about building and learning, you 100% should still demo even if your project isn't finished.

Finally, the top teams will be announced and present at our closing ceremonies, where they will demo their projects for everyone.

## Judging Criteria
Judging is based on three criteria:

- **Creativity**: We want hackers to create a project that makes you say "wow" and tell all your friends about it. We're looking for projects that think so far outside the box that you begin to wonder why there was a box at all in the first place.
- **Technical Complexity**: Hackers manage to build projects with remarkably complex infrastructures built on excitingly advanced frameworks. We hope to see projects that are really running some beautiful code or hardware under the hood.
- **Social Impact**: We're looking for hacks that are the blueprints for change that will impact future generations in humanity's most pressing areas of concern in the coming years.
